First I call the pizza store
I order a pepporoni medium pizza
The cashier told me it would take 20 minutes to make the pizza
After 10 minutes I start driving to the pizza store
Once I get there I pay 15 dollars for my pizza
I then drive back home and eat my pizza
After I ate the pizza I watched Netflix
After netflix I went to bed
